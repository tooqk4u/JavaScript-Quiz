This project is created with the following programming languages:

HTML CSS Javascript

This project is a JavaScript quiz that is timed. Time is deducted for wrong answers. The score is based upon the time left. At the end of the quiz the user has the choice to enter their initals to record their score. Scores are ranked under the high score tab in order from hightest to lowest.

This challenge required using javascript, HTML and CSS. The game demonstrates dynamically created elements and DOM manipulation techniques, including object persistence using localStorage. I ran into multiple issues with syntax as well as issues about the proper order of things in the js file. localStorage.getitem presented a challenge due to requiring an empty array with a conditional in order to attain persistence. The High Score function required some tweaking of the timeLeft variable due to not being 100% in synch with the end of game score.
